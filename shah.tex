I have accumulated around 8 years of corporate experience in application/systems security working on various areas of secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC). 
I have also acquired some certifications along way such as CISSP, CCSK and CEH.  


My primary objective to pursue PhD is to become subject matter expert in systems and software security area. 
After the program, I would like to take up strategic technical leadership position with a better understanding and approach to the complex problems. 
I would also like to play a role in the betterment of academic-corporate partnership in future research areas.

Questions for Parth:\\
\textit{Question 1: }Prajjwal here, hi. Can you share one way in which academic-corporate partnerships can be made better given both have unique advantages when it comes to research?
(Answer - Parth) I see security job involves many tasks which involves research but it stays within a team or at max within organization. 
There are fundamentally doing research but not putting it back to community in established structure (except some research department). 
Same goes otherway around, there is no push for organizations to keep their workforce have latest and greatest from research world to keep their knowledge and skills up to date.
