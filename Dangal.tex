I am currently in the Ph.D. in Security program at UCCS, with a focus in embedded systems security as it 
relates to the Experimental Physics \& Industrial Control System (EPICS). I am a firm believer in constant 
self-improvement through reading and communication while I have a penchant for music as well as poetry. My goal 
for this class is to become adept at the computer science research process. \par I hope this course will help 
me understand, in good detail, each stages of the scientific method viz. observation, problem formulation, 
hypothesis, prediction, testing the prediction, and iteration. I intend to fine tune my skills in each of these 
processes so that I will be able to make sound observations, ask better research question, design experiments 
better, foresee impediments ahead of time, and so on and so forth. I also hope to tap into the spangled 
research dexterity of the instructor, Dr. Boult and to augment my knowledge of presentation.

\subsection{Question \& answers for Prajjwal Dangal}\\
Question 1 by Parth: Regarding Music(obvious question on this) Do you play any instrument? \\ 
\textit{Answer: }Yes, I play the guitar and drum pad.

\subsubsection{Question \#2}
John here -- Why the focus in embedded systems security?\\
\textit{Answer: }Thanks for the question. It's because it deals with everything from critical national infrastructure like power grids to a home assistant like Alexa. Hence, it's imperative that we assure the smooth functioning of these systems which includes real-time response, safety, availability, protection from intrusion etc.
