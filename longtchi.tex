\section{Wer bin ich}
I am Theodore Longtchi, a Ph.D. student in Engineering with concentration in Security. I initially registered to take this course – CS 6000 – because it is a core requirement for my Ph.D. degree. However, just after a few classes, I can affirm that the course is absolutely necessary for any research student, except they had lots of prior research experience. I believe this course will help me build a strong research skill for my researches.

\textbf{Extracurricular}: I like following world affairs and politics with my favorite news outlet being my local radio station, KUOW at the University of Washington, which mostly relays NPR and other major radio stations like BBC, PRI, and CBC. I like playing soccer, walking and meditating how good/bad life's treating me, or reading my bicycle on the north Seattle Trail in the state of Washington where I life.
