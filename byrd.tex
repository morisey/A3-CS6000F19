My primary goal for this course are to determine whether I want to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy degree. My other goals include determining whether I'm interested in research, and I would particularly like to learn how to analyze data and show statistical relevance to support a hypothesis. I'd like to learn what kind of tests you can perform on the data to support your hypothesis. I'm studying Computer Science and this will be the last class I take for my master's degree. I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering, but I've mostly worked in the fields of software development and cybersecurity.

I work full time for an engineering consulting firm in the field of cybersecurity. My main motivation for graduate school was to become credentialed in the specific field that I've been working in since I completed my Bachelor's Degree. I would also like to open up more career options. I have two young children and with career, my available free time is constrained, so the decision to pursue more education after I complete my Master's Degree is a difficult one. I'm hoping this course will help to inform that decision. I've included a picture of myself above in figure \ref{fig:HS}.


Question1:

Manohar here - How do you manage your time to be fit and healthy?

Hi Manohar, I like to practice brazilian jiu jitsu and yoga

Question2:

Lawrence - Do you know what you want to do as a career? (this can be a large factor in whether it makes sense to pursue a PhD)

It would help me in my current position, but I'm not sure if that's enough reason to pursue it.
